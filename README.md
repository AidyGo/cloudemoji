# Cloud emoticon

Cloud emoticon that reads in emoticons on the cloud and allows one-click copying

## This is an Android app that
* Reads in an emoticon repository on the cloud (e.g a Dropbox publicly shared XML file)
* Shows on categorized lists
* Is capable of easy one-click copy && paste

## So that you don't have to
* Hack built-in dictionary files for input methods (e.g baidu / touchpal)
* Use other cloud services where their apps are slow and not one-click copy-paste capable (e.g Evernote)  
* Use other emoticon apps which are not customizable by you

## Configurable features
* Closes after copying
* Stays in notification area for quick access
* Navigation drawer / Split view
