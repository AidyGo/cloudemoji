# Cloud emoticon

A cloud solution to your favorite emoticons  

## This is an Android app that
* reads in an emoticon repository on the cloud (e.g a Dropbox publicly shared XML file)
* shows on categorized lists
* is capable of easy one-click copy && paste

## So that you don't have to
* hack built-in dictionary files for input methods (e.g baidu / touchpal)
* use other cloud services where their apps are slow and not one-click copy-paste capable (e.g Evernote)  
* use other emoticon apps which are not customizable by you

## Configurable features
* Close after copying
* Show in notification panel/status bar
* Navigation drawer / Split view
