Cloud emoji

An Android app that  
* Reads in an emoji "repository" on the cloud (e.g a Dropbox publicly shared file) that they create  
* Renders on a clean list  
* Allows easy one-click copy & paste  
    
So that users don't have to  
* Hack built-in dictionary files for input methods (e.g baidu / touchpal)  
* Use other cloud services where their apps are slow and not one-click copy-paste enabled (e.g Evernote)  
* Use other emoji apps that are not customizable  

Features  
* Closes after copying (configurable)  
* Stays in notification area for quick access (configurable)  

Dependency  
* PinnedHeaderListView: https://github.com/JimiSmith/PinnedHeaderListView
